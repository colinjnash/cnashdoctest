# Doc Test

## Objective

This repo is nothing more than a scratch pad for building documents with Sphinx. For now, this will remain unstructured. After watching the tutorials, the objectives of this project will be the following:

1. To restructure an existing document (such as a personal resume) into an article system with cross-references to all topics contained within.
2. To have that document searchable.
3. To have all contents of said document in a .md or .rst format.
4. To deploy automatically through a pipeline.
5. To lint during said deployment.

## Timeline

No timeline has been assessed. Currently, the project is in initial stages and is intended for personal use. However, any steps or commits may help those in the future, so all content will be presented to the public, "warts and all".
